\subsection{Parisian Gnocchi}

\paragraph{Ingredients (For dough):}

	\item 1 1/2 cup of water
	\item 6oz of unsalted butter
	\item 3/4 tsp kosher salt

	\item butter
	\item olive oil
	\item 2 table spoons chives
	\item 6 pureed garlic cloves
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Directions:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bring water, butter, and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add flour all at once and stir with a wooden spoon until a smooth dough forms. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to stir, beating dough forcefully and rapidly to prevent it from sticking to the pot. Continue cooking until dough pulls away from sides of pot leaving a thin layer and steams slightly.
	\item Transfer hot dough to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add mustard and cheese and beat on medium-low speed. Add eggs one at a time, allowing dough to fully incorporate egg before adding the next one. When final egg has been added, add herbs and beat to combine. Transfer mixture to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag or a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch tip.
	\item Let mixture rest 15 to 25 minutes at room temperature. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a simmer and have a rimmed baking sheet. If using a zipper-lock bag, cut off a 1/2-inch opening in one corner. Holding the bag over the boiling water, squeeze the mixture out of the bag, cutting it off with a paring knife into 1-inch lengths and letting them fall directly into the simmering water. Continue cutting off as many as you can in one minute, then stop.
	\item When all gnocchi have floated to the top, continue cooking until gnocchi are fully cooked to the center, about 3 minutes longer. 
	\item In a non-stick pan, add a bit of butter and olive oil, add gnocchi and garlic until the gnocci is golden brown. Do in batches.

\subsection{Asian Glazed Salmon in Foil}

\paragraph{Directions:}

  \item 3 tbsp maple syrup
  \item 2 tbsp sweet chili sauce

  \item 1 tsp fresh ginger minced
  \item 3 cloves garlic minced
  \item salt and pepper to taste
  \item 1-2 lb salmon fillet no skin
  \item 1 tbsp sesame seeds
  \item 2 green onions chopped
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Directions:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Preheat your oven to 375 F degrees. Place 2 foil sheets on a baking sheet. I used 2 foil sheets because I
want to make sure there’s enough foil to wrap around the salmon.
  \item In a small bowl whisk together the soy sauce, maple syrup, sweet chili sauce, lime juice, fresh ginger,
garlic, salt and pepper. The salt can probably be omitted since the soy sauce should have plenty of
sodium.
  \item Place the salmon fillet over the foil then pour about half the marinade over and brush if necessary to
cover the entire surface of the fish. Turn the fish over and pour the rest of the marinade. Also brush the
marinade making sure that the entire fish is brushed with marinade.
  \item Fold the edges of the aluminum foil over the salmon so that it is fully wrapped. Bake for about 20 to
25 minutes, depending on the size of your salmon. My salmon was quite a big piece, so I baked it for 25
minutes. You may also turn the broiler on and broil for about 2 to 3 minutes at the end if preferred.
  \item Open the foil and garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions.

almost instantly. Add the butter and stir, this will give the sauce a nice glossy color.
