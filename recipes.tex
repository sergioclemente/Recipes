    \item Kosher salt
    \item Freshly ground black pepper
    \item 1/2 cup diced shallots (2 medium shallots)
    \item 1/2 cup dry white wine
    \item 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
    \item 2 tablespoons whole-grain Dijon mustard
    \item 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
    \item 2 tablespoons heavy cream
    \item Coarsely chopped fresh parsley leaves, for serving (optional)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Directions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400°F. Meanwhile, sear the \textbf{chicken}.
    \item Heat the \textbf{oil} in a large cast iron or oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Meanwhile, pat the \textbf{chicken} dry with paper towels and season with \textbf{salt} and \textbf{pepper}. Add the \textbf{chicken} skin-side down to the pan and sear until the fat is rendered and the skin is crisp and golden-brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the \textbf{chicken} skin-side up to a large plate. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan.
    \item Add the \textbf{shallots} to the pan and cook over medium heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the \textbf{wine}, scrape up any browned bits at the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, and cook until evaporated, about 3 minutes. Stir in the \textbf{broth} and \textbf{whole-grain mustard} and bring to a simmer. Return the \textbf{chicken} skin-side up, and add any juices accumulated on the plate to the pan.
    \item Braise in the oven uncovered until the \textbf{chicken} is cooked through and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F, about 15 minutes. Transfer the \textbf{chicken} with tongs to a platter. Place the pan over medium-high heat, whisk the smooth \textbf{Dijon mustard} into the \textbf{sauce}, and simmer until reduced slightly, about 2 minutes.
    \item Remove from the heat and whisk in the \textbf{cream}. Taste and season the \textbf{sauce} with \textbf{salt} and \textbf{pepper} as needed. Serve the \textbf{sauce} with the \textbf{chicken} (we recommend serving it underneath the \textbf{chicken} to keep the skin crisp), and garnish with \textbf{parsley} if desired.

    \item Bring water, butter, and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add flour all at once and stir with a wooden spoon until a smooth dough forms. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to stir, beating dough forcefully and rapidly to prevent it from sticking to the pot. Continue cooking until dough pulls away from sides of pot leaving a thin layer and steams slightly.
    \item Transfer hot dough to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add mustard and cheese and beat on medium-low speed. Add eggs one at a time, allowing dough to fully incorporate egg before adding the next one. When final egg has been added, add herbs and beat to combine. Transfer mixture to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag or a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch tip.
    \item Let mixture rest 15 to 25 minutes at room temperature. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a simmer and have a rimmed baking sheet. If using a zipper-lock bag, cut off a 1/2-inch opening in one corner. Holding the bag over the boiling water, squeeze the mixture out of the bag, cutting it off with a paring knife into 1-inch lengths and letting them fall directly into the simmering water. Continue cutting off as many as you can in one minute, then stop.
    \item When all gnocchi have floated to the top, continue cooking until gnocchi are fully cooked to the center, about 3 minutes longer.

\subsection{Asian Glazed Salmon in Foil}

\paragraph{Ingredients:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1/4 cup soy sauce low sodium
    \item 3 tbsp maple syrup
    \item 2 tbsp sweet chili sauce
    \item 2 tbsp lime juice freshly squeezed
    \item 1 tsp fresh ginger minced
    \item 3 cloves garlic minced
    \item salt and pepper to taste
    \item 1-2 lb salmon fillet no skin
    \item 1 tbsp sesame seeds
    \item 2 green onions chopped
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Directions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Preheat your oven to 375 F degrees. Place 2 foil sheets on a baking sheet. I used 2 foil sheets because I want to make sure there’s enough foil to wrap around the salmon.
    \item In a small bowl whisk together the soy sauce, maple syrup, sweet chili sauce, lime juice, fresh ginger, garlic, salt and pepper. The salt can probably be omitted since the soy sauce should have plenty of sodium.
    \item Place the salmon fillet over the foil then pour about half the marinade over and brush if necessary to cover the entire surface of the fish. Turn the fish over and pour the rest of the marinade. Also brush the marinade making sure that the entire fish is brushed with marinade.
    \item Fold the edges of the aluminum foil over the salmon so that it is fully wrapped. Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, depending on the size of your salmon. My salmon was quite a big piece, so I baked it for 25 minutes. You may also turn the broiler on and broil for about 2 to 3 minutes at the end if preferred.
    \item Open the foil and garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions.

\subsection{Bravas Sauce}

\paragraph{Ingredients:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1/3 cup of olive oil
    \item 1/2 Tbsp. of pimentón picante hot smoked paprika

    \item 1 –2 Tbsp. of flour
    \item 1 cup of chicken broth or vegetable broth, for a vegetarian version
    \item Heavy cream

\begin{itemize}
    \item Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat.
    \item Add the pimentón dulce and pimentón picante and stir until combined.
    \item Add 1 tablespoon of flour and stir until combined. Keep stirring for about a minute, to toast the flour slightly.
    \item Over a medium-low heat, add the broth very gradually, stirring constantly. (This is similar to how you'd make a cream sauce. The flour will absorb the liquid and leave you with a delicious sauce.)
    \item The sauce should start to thicken as you incorporate the broth; add more flour only if necessary to achieve the right consistency (it should be velvety and smooth, but not so thick that it holds its shape alone).
    \item Reduce to low heat and simmer for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    \item Season with salt to taste.
    \item Drizzle over some fried potatoes and enjoy!
\end{itemize}

    \item Turn the heat up to high and add the potatoes back into the pan.
    \item Fry until crispy and golden.

\subsection{Croquetas de Jamon}

\paragraph{Ingredients:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 4 tbsp unsalted butter (60 g)
    \item 1/4 cup olive oil (60 ml)
    \item 1 scant cup flour (just under one cup — 120 g)
    \item 1 medium onion very finely diced
    \item 1/4 gallon whole milk at room temperature (1 liter)
    \item 1 pinch nutmeg
    \item 1/2 pound jamón serrano diced into small pieces (225 g)
    \item flour for breading
    \item 2 beaten eggs
    \item bread crumbs for breading (try Panko for non-traditional extra crispy croquettes!)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Directions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Melt the butter and warm the oil in a heavy pan over medium high heat.
    \item Add the diced onion and sauté for a few minutes, until it just starts to color.
    \item Add a pinch of salt and the nutmeg. Don't add too much salt as the Serrano ham is already salty.
    \item Add the diced ham and sauté for 30 seconds more.
    \item Add the flour and stir continuously, until the flour turns a light brown color. You must not stop stirring or the flour will burn!
    \item When the flour changes color, add the milk little by little, always stirring until you incorporate the entire amount. It should take about 15-20 minutes to add it all.
    \item Turn off the heat and let the dough cool to room temperature.
    \item Butter the sides of a large bowl and place the croquette dough inside, covered directly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate a minimum of 4 hours, but preferably overnight.
    \item To make the ham croquettes, shape them into little logs (or use a pastry sleeve if you have one.)
    \item Next, while heating a pan full of olive oil on the stove, pass the croquettes through the three step breading process. First, cover them in flour, then in egg, and, finally, in the breadcrumbs.
    \item Fry the ham croquettes in the hot oil for about five minutes (making sure to turn halfway so they brown evenly) and then let them cool for a few minutes before enjoying!

    \item Just when it begins to boil, add the rice, the snails, salt and saffron and remove the rosemary. At this moment the fire needs to be at its maximum.
    \item When the rice is cooking for about 10 minutes, decrease the heat gradually for at least another ten minutes.
    \item Once the paella is done and all the liquid has evaporated, let it stand for a couple of minutes to let it form the socarrat or socarradet (light crust of rice on the bottom of the pan) and then it’s ready.
